      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The universe is everything that exists. It includes all matter, energy, and the laws of physics that
        describe their behavior. The study of the universe is called astronomy, and it is one of the oldest
        sciences in human history.

      <h2>The Solar System</h2>
      <p>
        The Solar System is the collection of planets and other objects that orbit around the Sun. There are
        eight planets in our Solar System, and they are all very different from each other. In addition to the
        planets, the Solar System also includes moons, asteroids, comets, and other objects.

      <h2>Stars and Galaxies</h2>
      <p>
        A star is a massive, luminous ball of plasma that is held together by its own gravity. There are
        billions of stars in the universe, and they come in a wide range of sizes and colors. Galaxies are
        collections of stars, gas, and dust that are held together by gravity. The Milky Way is our home galaxy,
        and it contains billions of stars and many other objects.

      <h2>Black Holes</h2>
      <p>
        A black hole is a region of space where the gravitational pull is so strong that nothing, not even light,
        can escape. Black holes are formed when massive stars collapse in on themselves. They are some of the
        most mysterious objects in the universe, and scientists are still learning about how they work.
