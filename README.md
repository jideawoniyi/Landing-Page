Landing Page Project
This is a landing page project built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The landing page has a navigation bar with links that smoothly scroll to their respective sections on the page. It also has a scroll-to-top button that appears when the user scrolls past the last section of the page. In addition, it has a responsive design that works well on different screen sizes.

Usage
To view the landing page, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. You can then navigate the page using the links on the navigation bar or by scrolling through the sections of the page.

Dependencies
This project has no external dependencies. However, it uses Font Awesome icons for the scroll-to-top button. The Font Awesome CSS stylesheet is included in the project files and is linked to in the head section of the index.html file.
